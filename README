Lendr Introduction:
A community tool sharing application 
built to connect you to people willing to lend a tool or two. 

Whether its a hammer to hang that new picture in your apartment, 
a snow blower for that rough snow day, 
or a guitar to jam with a few hours in the park 

We're here to make it happen.
